just a place to keep some of the thingys i made for academic/misc help

1. PWpresence.py - for showing discord rich presence about 'Physics Wallah', run the application in terminal only (discord must be open and running)

2. discordrpc.py - a more general use application that can show discord rich presence ('Playing Studying...'). Again, application must be run in terminal only, and discord must be running.
